Hi! I’m Anders Wikström and I’m a type designer :)

Typefaces designed by me that will be available on this GitHub profile:

In addition, I have worked on many custom typefaces for various (mostly Swedish) clients. My personal portfolio site is at:

I’m interested in the intersection between design (especially type design) and tech. Also passionate about music.

I’m currently learning more about JavaScript, UX/UI design, and brand design.
